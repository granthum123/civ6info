                <p>Civilization 6 will be the latest iteration of the Sid Meiers Civilization franchise, and we couldn't be more excited.
                Following the landmark title that was Civilization 5 -- quickly returning back to earth after Civilization: Beyond Earth -- Civilization 6 promises to fulfill with deep strategical gameplay.
                Some very interesting changes have been made from previous generations of Civ, and the point of this first update is to give you all a quick overview of the most important of these changes.

                        The City management aspect will be vastly different in Civ 6. Instead of simply managing buildings inside of your city as in previous games,
                        the buildings will be built in various districts which you will strategically place surrounding your city. 
                        For instance, work related buildings such as workshops and factories will reside in a manufacturing district, while the military district will contain unit eperience buildings as
                        well as providing a second city attack! These changes promise to further increase the strategical elements involved with selecting city spots, as you will have to account for the placement of these crucial districts.

                        Units will no longer be limited to one per square. Firaxis has stated that they intend to allow at least two units per square, but not units of the same type. For instance, you may be able to 
                        send a melee unit along with a siege unit to protect your siege unit while it sets up. Additionally, they have hinted at specialized unit groupings, which may combine two or more different types of units 
                        into a specialized unit squad, which are likely to be very powerful. These strategic unit groupings will likely serve to balance between civ 4's "Tile of Death" infinite unit stacking concept and civ 5's sometimes frustrating 
                        one unit per tile policy.

                        The visuals of our home screen may have alerted you to striking differences from the graphics of previous generations. The style choices for Civ 6 has been heavily debated, but ultimately serves to 
                        give players a clearer and less cluttered view of what's happening, even from a high zoomout of the map. Additionally to the graphics changes, Firaxis have added an awesome day-night cycle which players 
                        may toggle to see their empire's skyscrapers and wonders light up the night.
